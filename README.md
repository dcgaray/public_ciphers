# public_ciphers
Objectives The objectives for this lab assignment are as follows: 
‚óè To explore public key cryptography 
o Implementing the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol 
o Implementing RSA encryption scheme

In this lab we will explore asymmetric key (public key) cryptography by
implementing the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and RSA encryption
scheme. It is important that we explore the properties of these schemes, and see how naive
implementations can lead to insecurity. 

Our implementationw is written in python and uses the PyCryptodome library.
It is installed using pip. To install simply use the '''~pip install pycryptodome'''
